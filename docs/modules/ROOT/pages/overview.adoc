= Introduction - V1.0

Limka is a framework (a packaged solution) that makes it easy for scientists and engineers to build, manage, package, 
and deploy machine learning models at scale.

[small]_Limka is aimed at addressing these problems by standardizing and simplifying the life cycle management of 
machine learning models at scale, which enable their reuse and shorten time to production._
